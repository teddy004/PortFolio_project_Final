## This project is our Final Portfolio Project, Build an Ecommerce website using NodeJS with React, concluding our FUll Stack Software Engineering Year at ALX-Africa School. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we presented a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.

## The scope of the project will be limited to some functions of the e-commerce website. It will display products, customers can select catalogues and select products, and can remove products from their cart specifying the quantity of each item. Selected items will be collected in a cart. At checkout, the item on the card will be presented as an order. Customers can pay for the items in the cart to complete an order. This project has great future scope. The project also provides security with the use of login ID and passwords, so that no unauthorised users can access your account. The only authorised person who has the appropriate access authority can access the software.
## Technologies and Architecture
# Overview
Our web app is a single-page app, coded mainly in React.js front-end and NodeJs at the back-end. Ecommerce is Front-end and Back-end heavy, meaning that we focused our time and energy in developing a simple but easy to use and fun app. We designed most of the User Interface, using plain SASS and some native ReactJS which is a JavaScript library that allows you to create user interfaces for your web projects on a component basis. We also incorporated some Bootstrap elements which offered a simple solution for some features like image uploading.
At the Back-end Nodjs for the API of our application using REST framework (RF). Nodejs is a JavaScript-based free and open-source web framework based on the model-view-controller architecture.
In this e-commerce, the following technologies were used:
MongoDB: It is a NoSQL-based database. It is in charge of data storage exchange and execution, assisting Node.JS in running the server without issue.
ExpressJS: It is essentially a back-end web-based framework that allows you to build web apps by providing an easy-to-use interface.
ReactJS: The frontend library would be React. Redux would be used for state management. For the basic design of the interface, we would employ the React Bootstrap library.
NodeJS: It is, by definition, a JavaScript runtime that is built on the well-known Chrome’s V8 JS engine and is known for being lightweight and efficient due to its use of an event-driven and non-blocking input-output model.
## The primary features of this ecommerce website application
    So, the features that we would include in the application that we would be developing are as follows.

    We are storing the JWT in Local Storage so that only logged-in users can purchase items.
    Option to pay and checkout, thereby creating an order and emptying the cart.
    Login and registration
    Purchase Product.
    Check Purchase Status.
    PayPal Payment Option
